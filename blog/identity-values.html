    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
     <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>

      <p>At a previous job, I decided to confront my employer about covid sick pay because I noticed that they had underpaid me according to government guidelines. It was a difficult decision to make because I didn’t want to run into issues with my employer but it felt morally right if I could set an example in some way. Looking back, I think I did the right thing but I wish that I could have advocated for my workmates at the time. </p>
      
     <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      
      <p>I grew up in a fairly large family of seven which required kindness and diplomacy to navigate while growing up. I think it’s led to a mode of conscientious awareness as an adult that I feel defines my identity somewhat. Despite that environment being slightly chaotic at times, I think it’s helped me develop clear communication, assertiveness and empathy. Growing up with a lot of internet use, I have always had a passion for information and seeking out what interests me (books, films, podcasts etc) and an interest in contributing to these pockets of culture myself.  </p>
      
      <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
      
      <p>My strengths are curiosity, creativity and judgement. Creativity will help me to approach web development with an open mind, allowing me to think outside the box and come up with unique solutions to problems. Judgement means that I can weigh evidence critically and note specific rather than generalised ways to improve on something. Being curious and seeking out knowledge is important for learning web development as an industry that is changing all the time. </p>
      
     <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
      
      <p>I think the ability to judge a situation critically can be helpful, sometimes it means that I get caught in details and struggle to ‘zoom out’ of a problem in order to get a more holistic view of what I should prioritise. It’s important for me to practice realising when I’m stuck and very actively stepping back from the problem-at-hand in order to consider, in a very general sense, what matters for the long-term realisation of a project. I think that learning in a way that challenges me to display my knowledge as a complete body of work will help in conceive problems more broadly. I guess the way that small solutions organically build up to bigger products is what I enjoy about coding. </p>
      
      <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
      
      <p>I think communicating and managing expectations is a really important aspect of trying to work with others. There have been times where I have overpromised and underdelivered because I burnt out by setting myself too much work. Ultimately it means that I need to understand my own working habits better and talk about this more effectively.
