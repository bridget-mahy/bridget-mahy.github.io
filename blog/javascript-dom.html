      <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS:</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is the coding language of the web. It can be used to manipulate static HTML and CSS elements, as well as making these elements interactive. Let’s say that HTML and CSS are the building blocks for a machine – HTML designates the type of part needed for the machine, and CSS designates how all the parts fit together. JavaScript is the fuel of the machine, allowing it to move and enact its mechanisms to serve a function. </p>
      <h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
      <p>‘Control flow’ describes the way that code is run. Typically, it runs from the first lines to last lines in consecutive order – this is how HTML is run, for example. With JavaScript, there are statements that can subtly alter this natural order such as loops or conditionals. Loops direct the control flow of code by requiring the code continue to run through an iterated sequence until the condition which stops the loop has been met. For example, this informs the syntax of ‘for loops’ (a type of loop in JavaScript): 

        The first section of the ‘for loop’ bracket, separated by a semicolon, describes where the loop begins. The second section describes when the loop should end. The third section describes how the loop should progress. The example below shows how the ‘for loop’ syntax directs the control flow of the code, when passing through the array named “fruits.”
      </p>

      <p>In the array, there are three listed items (‘Apple’, ‘Orange’, ‘Pear’). The loop begins at 0, at item ‘Apple,’ then increases the iterator, by one, each time the loop cycle has been completed. The loop finishes at the end of the fruits array. The result of the loop is shown in the console, illustrating that when the iterator [i], increases, the fruit that is logged to the console changes.

       ‘Control flow,’ as code that typically runs from beginning to end, could be analogised to the way that the day’s activities begin with sun and end with darkness. In the past, you wouldn’t be able to do day-time activities at night, and your day would effectively end there. Lighting at night allows people to set new conditions that dictate the end of their activities – like the desire to do something else, a task being understood as complete etc. Loops, by subverting the codes ‘control flow’ until their own specific conditions are met, are kind of akin to lights in the way they alter the natural sequence of human activities otherwise dictated by darkness.

      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3> 
      <p>DOM is short for ‘Document Object Model,’ and is a modelling of the html/CSS document as a JavaScript object that can be manipulated. It holds HTML, with its associated CSS elements, as children within the document. You might use JavaScript in the DOM console to change your static HTML elements – you can access HTML elements by using the “querySelector” function, and edit them with the ‘inner HTML’ function. JavaScript loops allow you to manipulate multiple elements at once. By targeting ‘events,’ the shorthand term for interactive gestures like keystrokes and clicks etc, it can be used to create responsive websites. </p>
