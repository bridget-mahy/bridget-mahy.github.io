    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to combine my curatorial knowledge with my skills in web development in order to curate online exhibitions or to help galleries digitise their collections for an online viewership.
      </p>
    <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
    <p>
      As I mentioned in the previous blogpost, my strengths are creativity, curiosity and judgement. I think my creativity, love of learning and critical thinking skills will really help me at bootcamp although I will have to take care in realising when I am focussing needlessly on ancillary details! I am gaining confidence in working with others so I am particularly excited about this part of bootcamp. A limitation that I have is that I can feel a bit discouraged when working on a larger project where I cannot see the incremental progress I am making on it. I think occasionally, if I am not actively tracking the passing time, I can get lost in smaller problems. I noticed this particularly in foundations at moments when I needed to google something. I would skim articles without reading them and get frustrated when the answer I needed wasn’t readily available. I think in these moments it might be better to seek out a youtube video which sets the pace of learning in a more regimented way – forcing me out of the fugue-state that can come with frantically skimming through articles. Getting better at searching for information is something I hope to improve during Bootcamp!
    </p>
    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
     <p>
       I think my biggest challenge will be maintaining an effective working schedule while learning online. I will need to make sure that I am getting to sleep early enough for an 8:30-ish start and that I am taking proper breaks by going outside away from the computer. So far the pomodoro method has really helped me with keeping track of the time. 
    </p>
    <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p>
        Definitely giving/receiving feedback and maintaining confidence in my ability during this process. I have historically taken criticism a little personally which I think also holds me back from advising others. I’d like to get more comfortable with the feedback process and become less tentative in my response to feedback. 
     </p>
    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
        I guess my general expectation is open communication about what work is expected and the ability to reach out for support at the right times. Having a knowledge of what staff schedules/’office hours’ are so that I can ask for help during these times would be good. It would help me set up an expectation of when advice can be given so that I can prepare my questions for that allocated time. Advance notice of due dates/ and if applicable, due times would really help me figure out my schedule, especially when it comes to doing extra on weekends etc. 
      </p>
    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        I want to set myself the expectation of 60 hours a week, even if that means doing a little bit more than the work that’s allocated e.g. stretch activities. I also want to allocate a little extra time on the weekends (a couple hours or so) so that I can stay sharp on the new information that I’m learning. I’d like to be employable once bootcamp ends!

    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan:</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>My long term goal is to work at the intersection between art and tech. Ideally I’d like to use my web dev skills and curatorial knowledge for art institutions aiming to develop an online presence.  </p>
    
    <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h2>
<p>My limitations are that I can be a little disorganized at times, although this is something I’m working on more by building routine habits. At times, I also can find prioritization difficult and I notice myself getting caught up in the minutiae of problems.
  My strengths are that I’m creative, driven and I love learning. I find that I learn best in the creative process where I am forced to organize my thoughts into a legible and functional solution, particularly on highly specific problems.</p>

<h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p>I’d like to develop communication skills within a team setting. I didn’t have much experience with this at university so I’d appreciate some insight into the everyday communication required for collaborative projects.
I sense that I have become a more organized person since I have made a dedication to myself to work on my routine. Taking breaks from the screen is important and something that I plan for. I am staying with my parents at the moment who live on a farm so my work outside/around the house tends to involve exercise and engagement with nature which has helped me disengage from my screen. 
In terms of working with others, I try to encourage others to communicate openly about any difficulties they may be having by being open myself. Being honest about your limits, and supporting others is important when working in a group. 
When things start to build up, I definitely think it’s important to reach out for help quickly. I have been using the Discord for that for the most part. I try not to be stuck for more than 15 minutes on a problem without thinking about reaching out for help.</p>
