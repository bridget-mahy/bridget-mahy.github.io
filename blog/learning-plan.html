    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>My long term goal is to work at the intersection between art and tech. Ideally I’d like to use my web dev skills and curatorial knowledge for art institutions aiming to develop an online presence.  </p>
    
    <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h2>
<p>My limitations are that I can be a little disorganized at times, although this is something I’m working on more by building routine habits. At times, I also can find prioritization difficult and I notice myself getting caught up in the minutiae of problems.
  My strengths are that I’m creative, driven and I love learning. I find that I learn best in the creative process where I am forced to organize my thoughts into a legible and functional solution, particularly on highly specific problems.</p>

<h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p>I’d like to develop communication skills within a team setting. I didn’t have much experience with this at university so I’d appreciate some insight into the everyday communication required for collaborative projects.
I sense that I have become a more organized person since I have made a dedication to myself to work on my routine. Taking breaks from the screen is important and something that I plan for. I am staying with my parents at the moment who live on a farm so my work outside/around the house tends to involve exercise and engagement with nature which has helped me disengage from my screen. 
In terms of working with others, I try to encourage others to communicate openly about any difficulties they may be having by being open myself. Being honest about your limits, and supporting others is important when working in a group. 
When things start to build up, I definitely think it’s important to reach out for help quickly. I have been using the Discord for that for the most part. I try not to be stuck for more than 15 minutes on a problem without thinking about reaching out for help.</p>
