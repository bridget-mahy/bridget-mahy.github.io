        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>In a broad sense, I think emotional intelligence is about perceptivity and receptivity to the world around and your own emotional state. It’s important to distinguish this perceptivity to life from the rationalising mechanism in the brain that codes our experiences into a fixed narrative. It’s this compulsive, “rationalising” mechanism that causes the most issues ultimately in my opinion – lending itself to an inattentiveness to change due to relying on a shorn picture of oneself and others. I think realising the influence that this emotional undercurrent ultimately holds over behaviours, politics, and “rationality” itself, is the key to becoming more emotionally intelligent. If emotional intelligence is about relating to others with this in mind, then the goal becomes awareness of one’s own and others emotions rather than attempting to maintain distance from your emotions, or generalising the reasons behind others actions.</p>  
         <h1>How is EQ different to IQ?</h1>
          <p>Intelligence Quotient is a measurement based on a test of reasoning ability. It tests analytical skills like pattern detection and memorisation whereas EQ is about soft skills like relating to and working with others. EQ is about adapting to a flexible, perspectival metric, quite unlike the centralised metric of intelligence, without compromising yourself.</p>
          
          <p>While general intelligence helps with digesting information and analogising it, emotional intelligence is ultimately how you can make yourself understood by others. It’s the ability to read your audience and the context that you need to communicate in. While IQ initially seems important in communication because we typically understand communication to be information-oriented, it seems like EQ is the actual and practical bottom line defining how your words are practically received.</p>
         <h1>Why is EQ important?</h1>
          <p>We live in a necessarily social world. Throughout human life cooperation has been needed to make things larger than ourselves as individuals. Emotional intelligence gives you the skills to better represent yourself and allows you to work alongside people who have different strengths. Disputes and emotional conflicts that inevitably arise in social life become easier to manage if you can gain an awareness of your own emotions and an open, kind attitude towards others. Offering your abilities to other people is a great way to support them and helps you build a picture of yourself that is broader and more meaningful.</p>
