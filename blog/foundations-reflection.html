      <h1>Reflections on Foundations</h1>
      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          <li>
            Reflecting on my learning is a new exercise for me and I think something that has been valuable. I’ve learned how this technique is an important remedy to distraction. In the process of writing responses, I’ve learned that thought can become confused if it isn’t challenged with the need to communicate or recall information – even as I might internally reassure myself otherwise. Writing down my approach to problems, along with the feelings that come with problem-solving, helps me become more aware of where my energy is directed and in finding ways to alleviate inattention. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I think I’ve noticed certain negative feelings arise when reflecting on my abilities and the desire to improve. My instinct is to be quite critical of where I am currently, even if it’s something that I try not to express outwardly. Again, writing has been a really interesting exercise in this regard as it draws attention to this gap between how I feel and my self-expression. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I’ve learned also through this core learning that I enjoy working with others! In the past, my hospitality/retail work environments have made me feel a little socially withdrawn at times – particularly because customer interaction is quite emotionally demanding. Working on coding/problem-solving tasks is a nice way to bond with others and also requires I articulate my own thoughts – resulting in clearer causal thinking. 
          </li>
        </p>
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
          Broadly, values are figureheads for ethical guidelines that groups or individuals hold themselves to. I’ve personally found it difficult to identify myself with the philosophy of “values” (as universal moral categories that people associate as a part of their personality) mainly because it feels like anyone can justify their behaviour with this sentiment, especially politically. While I might agree with someone on the importance of a value like ‘kindness,’ we might have differing views of what that actually is. That being said, outside of the realm of identity, values are useful in so far as they point to certain behaviours. I’ve found that patience and observation are really important as social skills undergirding empathy/self-awareness – and seem like values that have been somewhat neglected today. Patience and observation, it turns out, are helpful to programming too. The difficulty of an exercise like active listening is both a reflection of a social skill that needs improving upon as well as a programming/learning skill that requires the same attention! In this way, it seems like an improvement to empathy and self-awareness, both skills important to collaborative work like programming, are also an improvement to programming in itself as a solo activity. Social skills are really versatile in this way. 
        </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I think I’ve been surprised by the fact that I do have opinions about these topics, despite not giving them too much thought in my daily life. It always initially seems, when I read each question, that I don’t have anything to say, but when I challenge myself to come up with a response I find that I do! There’s something satisfying about the effect that actively holding opinions has on the identity and sense of self. This realisation encourages me to have a little more conviction in what I have to say, and open myself up to the idea that I have something worthwhile contribute even if my instinct says otherwise or my mind feels blank. 
        </p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Definitely this aspect of ‘having an opinion’ that I mentioned previously. I had always thought that communication was about effectively communicating when you have something to say. It seems more clear to me now that half of the effort of communicating is asking yourself to form an articulate opinion, whether you think you have something to say or not!
        </p>
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
          People who can express themselves clearly, have a strong sense of self and a social intuition tend to do well at work and handle difficulties in life better. The knowledge that these aren’t innate personality traits but skills that can be improved upon means they make sense as part of a curriculum based upon ‘job-readiness’
        </p>
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h2>
        <p>
          The core work feels more difficult to me than the tech work a lot of the time! I don’t necessarily see that difficulty as a waste of time. To find something difficult is a sign that you are being challenged to improve and I don’t doubt that this learning is important to programming as the ability to self-reflect seems useful for life in general. I will admit there is a part of me that resents the work a little, perhaps because it is hard and it feels easier to be somewhat ignorant about whether my current approach to learning works or not. 
        </p>
      <h2>Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
          I don’t think so. It seems rare in programming to work on a project completely by yourself – and employers are looking for people who can operate well in this environment. I have felt more clear about my learning here than I have at university simply because Dev Academy has required frequent reflection (something that has helped me with prioritisation, self-assessment, communicating with others and time management). It also seems to me that the logic behind communication even strengthens your ability to think through a programming problem! (e.g. pseudocode, formulate a coherent question for google etc.)
