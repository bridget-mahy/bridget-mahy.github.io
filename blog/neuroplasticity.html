      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
      <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity helps people understand how knowledge and habit is formed in the mind. With this understanding, mental quirks or qualities that were believed to be fixed can be built upon or surpassed. Rather than identifying with any fixed qualities, even if they are positive, a belief in neuroplasticity allows you to identify with learning itself. It’s a set of principles that generates a confidence in your ability to improve, rather than a complacent attitude about who you are at the current moment.
       </p>
      <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
        <p>
          I do meditate and exercise often on the general basis of these principles. Personally, I think it’s important to think about neuroplasticity through a political lens as well – just in terms of analysing how exactly one’s attention is harnessed and potentially weaponised in today’s media landscape (whether that is intended by commercial powers or not, is not necessarily important). With an awareness of how your mind develops and changes, you can become both active and defensive in your approach to moulding your identity/behaviours.
        </p>
      <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
        Being more reflective on how you learn, and where distractions/blocks arise, builds a meta-awareness of your current thought patterns and additionally the tools to adjust your learning methods. I think generally making the effort to learn and think about what you consume, is also a big step up from the consumer habits that digital society encourages. The stumbling block I encounter most is failing to recognise that, even though I have theoretically spent time doing one thing, my attention has been fragmented by constant context changes or indecision within the scope of the task at hand. Being able to recognise when you are moving too fast, and moving ineffectively, is important.

      <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
      <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is the application of neuroplasticity in the self-help arena. It seems to pose similar implications to neuroplasticity but emphasises the agency that people have over their cognition. I think it’s interesting although the language around it is slightly neutered – “growth” often implies a kind of cognitive upward mobility: a bid toward success in the sphere of economic competition. In terms of learning though, it makes sense to understand development as possible and to pursue improvement. The only downside I potentially see to this way of framing plasticity, is that today we are overwhelmed with information. Optimistic messaging about the potential to grow and develop is nothing without the tools to critically navigate this information. Casting off a deterministic vision of yourself is a start, but I fear that it won’t help if we can’t approach learning itself with constructive criticism. Being indiscriminate about “growing the mind” might generate a learner who is openminded and eager but consumes information confusedly without gaining knowledge. 
        </p>
      <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve been aware of this ideology for a while now! It seems to be accompanied with educational/corporate vogues like learning styles and personality tests which I find ultimately useless. I was surprised though, that this development in neuroscience presents a shift from deterministic evolutionary thinking, which has ideologically conditioned political economy since Darwin, toward something else… a potential way out of the cycle of endless competition?
        </p>
      <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
          With the idea that growth can be personally defined, I will find it helpful in moments where I am identifying too much with being stuck in a coding problem. If growth is something that is not only possible, but recognisable, then it means that I will be able to identify scenarios where I am growing from scenarios where I am not. It will help me be more open to criticism/feedback and take it less personally.
