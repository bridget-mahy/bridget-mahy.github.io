      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <body>
      <h2>Tell a non-tech friend about a time when you were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
       <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
        <p>
          I was blocked on task that asked me to create a function which was supposed to:
        </p>
          <li>Read an input of a name and a test score</li>
          <li>Recognise whether that name was in the data I already had</li>
          <li>Move the test score to the name of the person in my dataset</li>
        <p>
          I found it difficult to code the recognition part. In code, we use variable/parameter names so that, when we code, we can understand what data is getting fed through different coded processes. It can be hard sometimes to remember that the computer does not see the variable name when data is getting passed into that position. The variable name is just there as a placeholder so that humans can better understand how the code is functioning. As a result, when coding the part where the computer searches for the student name in my dataset, I was attempting to match up the “student name” variable received into my function with the “student name” variable in my dataset. I had forgotten that the computer does not need to understand that these are both “student names,” all it needs to know is whether the input “X” is in the dataset. I effectively was writing the redundant code, “if input X equals dataset X, then find out if the dataset has input X.” To the computer, input X and dataset X are exactly equal, if there is no X in the dataset, then the input will not be processed.

        <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
          <p>I reached out for help on the Discord channel and that was really effective.</p>
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process? + What did you learn?</h3>
          <p>
            I felt confused for a while about why my code didn’t work because, from my perspective, it made logical sense that the two types of data were distinguished – and the connection needed to be explained. Once I realised that the computer does not see the variable name, it helped me think through subsequent problems with “placeholder” logic. This made my working through problems more systematic.

      <h2>Tell a non-tech friend about a time when you elegantly solved a problem:</h2>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
        <p>
          The deBee challenge which required you to remove the word “buzz” from a sentence. 
        </p>
        <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
          <p>
            I knew that I needed to use the map function so I googled around trying to find documentation where someone had solved a similar problem using that method. I also used replit and console.logged a lot, especially to make sure I knew what the computer understood each variable to be was correct. Someone also posted a helpful link in the discord.
          </p>
        <h3>how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
          <p>
            Very satisfied once I found the methods a bit more familiar to me. I have noticed it’s a lot easier to tackle problems if the material is still fresh in your mind. I feel quite comfortable asking for help on the discord now.
          </p>
        <h3>what did you learn?</h3>
          <p>
            Once I understood that .map(), for the most part, takes a function as its argument, I felt more comfortable. At the moment I find it a lot easier to define the callback function outside of the .map brackets. If it has a descriptive name, it is easier to see what is happening to the old array and what the new array will look like. 
          </p>
      <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
            <p>
              This was really helpful. I like writing what I expect each part/line to do on the line above – it helps me isolate line by line any potential issues in my code. It also forces me to be a bit more specific about the mechanics of the functions etc so that I understand what each aspect is meant to do, not just the aim of the function as a whole.
            </p>
          <li>Trying something</li>
            <p>
              I use this all the time. I find though that I can get a little frustrated just trying things blindly. I get more success by forcing myself to think through the problem. It is good for attempting to recall syntax or other small solutions to bugs as it tests my memory with immediate feedback. 
            </p>
          <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
           <p>
            This is probably the technique that I’m the least good at. I prefer to emulate this process by questioning my pseudocode, and asking myself how I can make it more specific. 
           </p>
          <li>Googling</li>
           <p>
             MDN webdocs is still a little intimidating – especially with understanding syntax. Articles from freeCodeCamp and Codecademy are the most helpful. 
           </p>
          <li>Reading error messages</li>
            <p>
              This is pretty helpful although I think I still have a hard time asking myself “why” this part doesn’t work. I find if it’s throwing an error, I’ll just delete the line and start over. 
            </p> 
          <li>Console logging</li>
            <p>
              As I said above, really helpful for thinking through the problem from the computer’s perspective. I can get caught up in the logic of variable names sometimes.
            </p>
          <li>Asking your peers for help + asking coaches for help</li>
           <p>
             I ask for help in the discord fairly regularly. I am open to advice from anyone! 
           </p>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
            <p>
              I feel, that in the moment, reflection can only happen once I really take a break from the task at hand. In that moment, catering to what the body is experiencing is the most important thing. Reflection won’t help unless you have the tools to recognise when you are lost in something.
